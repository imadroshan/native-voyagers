This one could not have been better placed.\" Built of red Neckar sandstone on the terraced hillside nearly 200 meters directly above Heidelberg's Old Town, this 16th-century castle is one of the best examples of German Renaissance architecture.\n\nAfter its destruction by the French, who devastated the Palatinate in the 17th century, it has remained the largest and most picturesque such ruin, and one of the best castles in Germany.\n\nThe castle is the site of many festivals, most held in its evocative courtyard, where there are also frequent theater performances, concerts, and fireworks displays. One of the most popular events is the Heidelberg Castle Festival from June to August, which features an eclectic mix of theater, choral music, chamber orchestras, jazz, folk, and opera.\n\nHeidelberg Castle can be reached by the Bergbahn, a funicular railway running from the Kornmarkt, or via a 15-minute walk from the Old Town.\n\nAddress: Schlosshof 1, Heidelberg",

From this narrow main street, you'll find countless even narrower side streets and alleyways just begging to be explored, each bursting with things to see: unspoiled medieval architecture, splendid old churches, boutique shops, galleries, cafés, and restaurants.\n\nHighlights include the early 15th-century Heiliggeistkirche, the Church of the Holy Spirit, and Haus zum Ritter, a Renaissance building dating from 1592. Other highlights include the Neckarstaden where you'll find Marstall, the old court stables and home of Heidelberg University's art collection, as well as the Stadthalle adjoining the landing stages for the many boats that take tourists for cruises along the castle-lined Neckar.\n\nIn December, the outstanding Heidelberg Christmas Market is so large it fills five city squares; one becomes a public skating rink, while the Kornmarkt is transformed into a fairy-tale scene with the lighted castle towering above.\n\nIf you want to explore the Old Town with a local guide who will share interesting historical and cultural contexts, the two-hour Heidelberg Old Town Tour is a good choice. This walking tour includes stops at landmark buildings, Market Square, the Old Bridge, and other top sights.\n\n",
