This one could not have been better placed.\" Built of red Neckar sandstone on the terraced hillside nearly 200 meters directly above Heidelberg's Old Town, this 16th-century castle is one of the best examples of German Renaissance architecture.\n\nAfter its destruction by the French, who devastated the Palatinate in the 17th century, it has remained the largest and most picturesque such ruin, and one of the best castles in Germany.\n\nThe castle is the site of many festivals, most held in its evocative courtyard, where there are also frequent theater performances, concerts, and fireworks displays. One of the most popular events is the Heidelberg Castle Festival from June to August, which features an eclectic mix of theater, choral music, chamber orchestras, jazz, folk, and opera.\n\nHeidelberg Castle can be reached by the Bergbahn, a funicular railway running from the Kornmarkt, or via a 15-minute walk from the Old Town.\n\nAddress: Schlosshof 1, Heidelberg\n\n",
